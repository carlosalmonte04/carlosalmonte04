# Contributing to open source.

This skill is well known as one of the skills that can differentiate someone in the tech industry. It is so widely mentioned that it becomes an intimidating event to contribute to open source; “only geniuses can contribute to open source”. However, it is not so intimidating after all. If you have been in the industry for some time, contributing to open source feels just like work.

Some day you might find yourself debugging code, another day you may find yourself chatting over the best approach to fix an issue.

For me open source on GitHub project typically looks as follows: 
1.	Navigate to a library you would like to contribute
2.	Navigate to the issues tab
3.	Look over the open issues until you find one you can contribute
4.	And contribute!

Contributing does not necessarily means submitting a PR to merge your code. Contributing can be just having a conversation in the comment section. You can also help tremendously by replicating issues to confirm if it the issue is valid or if the issue is just an environment error on OP’s computer. This can help save valuable time debugging.

There are tons of issues on GitHub that can entertain your time. It feels just like work minus the anxiety of meetings and the pressure of deadlines. 

Please be courteous. Respect others as you would like to be respected. Don’t be biased against others. Contribute with knowledge that is canonical, in other words don’t spread misinformation. Only comment when you know the content and be obvious when you are expressing an opinion vs a fact.
