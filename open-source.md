# Contributing to Open Source
https://medium.com/@carlosalmonte04/contributing-to-open-source-4ea279c1d031

The help we receive from open source is an intimidating amount. I would not have found coding such an entertaining job if it were not thanks to open source. I began as a self-taught developer and if I did not know how to center a `div` I would google 'how to center a `div`' and shortly the answer would appear on StackOverflow, and there I was with my `div` right in the damn center. That person is a genius! 

From centering a `div` to finishing a configuration file, the amount of work you can get done using open source is plenty. Contributing to open source might feel scary at first but if you have been in the industry for some time, contributing to open source feels just like work. Some day you might find yourself debugging code, another day you may find yourself chatting over the best approach to fix an issue.

For me open source on GitHub project typically looks as follows:

1. Navigate to a library you would like to contribute.
2. Navigate to the issues tab.
3. Look over the open issues until you find one you can contribute.
4. And contribute!

Contributing does not necessarily means submitting a PR, contributing can be just having a conversation in the comment section to provide your feedback. Maybe you have encountered a similar issue before and might be able to provide the approach you took, does not necessarily have to be the solution, this can help rule out one of the many approaches that can be taken for a given issue.

You can also help tremendously by replicating issues to confirm if it the issue is valid or if the issue is just an environment error on OP's computer. This can help save valuable time debugging.

Here are different ways you can contribute to React Native for example https://reactnative.dev/contributing/overview#ways-to-contribute.

There are tons of issues on GitHub that can entertain your time. It feels just like work minus the anxiety of meetings and the pressure of deadlines. 
Please be courteous. Respect others as you would like to be respected. Don't be biased against others. Contribute with knowledge based on facts, in other words don't spread misinformation. Only comment when you know the content and be obvious when you are expressing an opinion vs a fact, this might help avoiding distractive comments.
