This text you are reading right now is stored somewhere in your device. Somewhere in the RAM there is a sequence of on/off elements that represent this blog post. And just how you read content on a piece of paper, you read the contents of your RAM through the screen. This is so seamless that we forget how physical this process is.

Make no mistake, there is no magic behind it, this text is indeed physical just like the papers in your mailbox, instead of ink and paper, the contents are written using electricity into very tiny containers called transistors.

Transistors, store electricity in different voltage levels depending on the content they store. This process is no magic and in fact, transistors store electricity in very specific ranges that help us identify on/off states for each of them. 

A sequence of transistor, each with different voltages helps us create the necessary sequence of voltages needed to represent content. In the 7400 chip when a transistor voltage is between 0 – 0.8v it signifies a logical 0 or off state, if a transistor voltage is between 2 – 5v it signifies a 1 or on state [1].

When coding your next React Native component, don’t forget that you are controlling how electricity is store in transistors. Even though garbage collection is already written for us it is a fun part of programming to think about.
